üå± Project Overview: MindBloom
MindBloom is a hyper-personalized mental wellness and self-improvement platform designed to guide diverse users on a comprehensive journey of self-discovery and growth. It combines behavioral science, AI-driven personalized coaching, and gamified interaction to improve emotional resilience, self-awareness, and overall mental health outcomes.

üí° Target Audience Deep Dive
‚Ä¢	Individual Health Matrices: Users with varying mental health baselines (e.g., mild anxiety, moderate depression, high-stress corporate workers, ADHD, burnout-prone students).
‚Ä¢	Medical Analysis Integration: Users are prompted to optionally provide medical history (diagnosed mental conditions, past therapies, medication) during onboarding. This data helps to calibrate insights and avoid potentially harmful advice.
‚Ä¢	Socioeconomic Context:
o	Low-income users or underserved communities may face limited access to traditional therapy. The app offers free baseline features, offline journaling, and localized coping strategies (e.g., mindfulness practices that don't require extra resources).
o	High-income or corporate users may prefer advanced analytics, executive burnout tracking, or deeper AI-based goal-setting modules.
‚Ä¢	Cultural Sensitivity: Multilingual support, culturally adapted personality archetypes, and localized "Challenge Pets" to resonate with different backgrounds.

‚ú® Core Features Expanded
‚Ä¢	Personality & Health Profiling: Combines Big Five personality assessment with optional health matrices (stress level, sleep quality, physical activity, diet habits). Users can upload wearable data or self-reports.
‚Ä¢	Dynamic "Personality Pet": Visual companion evolving based on combined personality and health inputs, creating a playful, empathetic feedback loop.
‚Ä¢	Mood Tracking & Contextual Journaling: Goes beyond simple emoji logging ‚Äî captures context like sleep hours, exercise, social interactions, work stressors, income-related stress, and environmental factors (noise level, living conditions).
‚Ä¢	AI Behavioral Analysis: The "What did I do that?" feature deconstructs patterns by combining journal analysis, historical mood data, and external stressor tagging. For example, it might show how financial worries correlate with increased irritability.
‚Ä¢	Personalized Strategy Generator: Instead of generic tips, strategies are weighted based on medical risk factors, socioeconomic stressors, and lifestyle constraints. For example, for a low-income user, suggestions might focus on community support or home-based mindfulness exercises.
‚Ä¢	Gamified Challenges ("Challenge Pets"): Personalized based on dominant mental barriers ‚Äî e.g., a "Doubt Dragon" for imposter syndrome, "Guilt Goblin" for chronic guilt. Pets evolve as users log progress or overcome thought distortions.

üó∫Ô∏è Phases & Roadmap for Development (Expanded with Procedural Thinking)
üìç Phase 1: Onboarding & Health Matrix Profiling
‚Ä¢	Setup UI: Persona and personality pet selection screens, plus optional medical and socioeconomic questionnaire.
‚Ä¢	Context Data: Capture lifestyle factors (work hours, income range, family structure, access to green spaces).
‚Ä¢	Privacy & Security: Implement strong consent flows for health data, fine-grained privacy controls.
üìç Phase 2: Core Daily Interactions
‚Ä¢	Mood & Context Logging: Mood tracking with environmental/context tags (e.g., "felt sad after overtime work," "anxious before rent payment").
‚Ä¢	Journal Entry UI: Sentiment suggestions, optional voice-to-text.
‚Ä¢	Health Data Import: Pull daily sleep/activity metrics from connected devices.
üìç Phase 3: AI Analysis & Challenge Mapping
‚Ä¢	Sentiment & Pattern Detection: Use Gemini API to correlate journals and health data, flag early warning signs (e.g., depressive spirals, burnout patterns).
‚Ä¢	Personalized Challenges: Assign "Challenge Pets" representing psychological themes derived from data.
‚Ä¢	Medical Red Flags: Alert users to seek professional help if severe patterns are detected, with localized therapist or hotline suggestions.
üìç Phase 4: Adaptive Strategy & Guidance
‚Ä¢	Solution Tailoring: Suggest daily actions that consider income constraints, physical environment, and cultural context (e.g., "take a mindful walk in local park" instead of "go to expensive gym").
‚Ä¢	"Why Did I Do That?" Module: Explain root causes based on emotional, behavioral, and socioeconomic data.
üìç Phase 5: Progress & Social Integration
‚Ä¢	Dashboard UI: Visual graphs showing interplay between mood, health metrics, socioeconomic stress.
‚Ä¢	Pet Sanctuary: Showcase evolving "Personality Pet" and "Challenge Pets" as visual metaphors for progress.
‚Ä¢	Community Support: Optional peer support circles, localized community resource suggestions.
‚Ä¢	Advanced Analytics: For premium or corporate users ‚Äî resilience score trends, burnout risk scores, personalized coaching metrics.
